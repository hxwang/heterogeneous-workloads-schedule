## [Few-to-Many: Incremental Parallelism for Reducing Tail Latency in Interative Services](http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ricardob/papers/asplos15-fm.pdf)

### Summary
- This paper proposed a incremental parallelism approach aiming to reduce tail latency in interative services.
- Their work based on the assumption that
  - The running time of job is hard to predict when it arrives.
- Their mechanisms work by
  - First, compute an offline table to decide the time interval to increase parallelism
  - Then, they increase the parallelism in the running time based on the computed table
