## Introduction

### What is heterogenous workloads?
- **web workloads**: typically hosted on a collection of clustered application servers
- **batch workloads**: or non-interactive workloads such as portfolio analysis, document indexing and various types of scientific computations.

### Challenge?
- **Resource management**: Organizations allows heterogenous workloads to execute on the same set of hardware resources and need a resource management technology to determine the most effective allocation of resources to particular workloads.
